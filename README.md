# 💬 Chat App

This is a practice project I created to improve my ReactJS and JavaScript skills.

A real-time chat application created with React, Firebase, and Vite. This project enables users to authenticate themselves, search for other users, add them to their chat list, and exchange messages in real time. The user interface is sleek and responsive, with capabilities for managing users and receiving notifications.

📍 **The Process**

I intended to create a modern chat app with a clear interface and real-time functionalities. The project began with React and Vite to facilitate rapid development. Firebase handles authentication and real-time messaging, whilst Cloudinary is used for picture uploading. Zustand is designed for simple and scalable state management. The user interface is styled with modular CSS to make it easier to maintain. The program is still a work in progress, but the main chat and user functions work!

In future commits, I'll replace the Vanilla CSS with Tailwind CSS and add one or two features (such as AI to summarize informs and respond on your behalf, and lofi music to relax a bit when chatting with a friend), but this is primarily a practice project.
